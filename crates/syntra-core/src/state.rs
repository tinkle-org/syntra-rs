//! CLOSING -> CLOSED` with the transition table in handshake.md section 1B.
//! No shortcuts, no extra wire states, no re-handshake on one transport
//! (`SNTR-HS-040`). Suggested names map informatively:
//! `DISCONNECTED` = no transport yet (outside Syntra),
//! `TRANSPORT_ESTABLISHED` = `CONNECTED`, and `ERROR` is not a
//! wire-visible state (failures carry a typed code then move to
//! `CLOSING`/`CLOSED`).
